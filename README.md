Task 
-----------
Purpose of project was to utilise skills gained during 8-week bootcamp and produce working web application which supports API calls.

Web Application (Idea)
-----------
Web application allows users to upload links to hosted pictures along with title and description. In addition, full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality has been developed which can be accessed either by direct communication with website or through API calls. Website has been designed to accommodate all screen sizes (phones, tablets, laptops, desktops) as well as good contrast colours to ensure that users from al age groups are comfortable using website.

Web Application (Creation)
-----------
Step 1: Creation of Trello Boards

    - Used Trello board to break down tasks into manageable pieces

    - Used frequently to monitor my progress and align any changes regarding development process

Step 2: Creation of website wireframes

    - Used MS Word to draw wireframes to have visual understanding of how website should look like

Step 3: Research stage

The following technologies was used in the creating of the website:

    - Backend: Java / Spring Boot

        -> Used Java Spring Boot software to develop backend and make website functional through API calls.

    - Database: MongoDB 

        -> MongoDB is a NoSQL database which is very popular, and it was an interesting experiment trying to implement project using it. It was successful and very stable regarding needs of the website.

    - Frontend: HTML / JS / CSS / React.JS

        -> Always wanted to try React and now was a great chance to do so. It was rough as it is quite complex framework to get head around, but I managed to implement most of the things I planned whilst learning on the go. Used Pluralsight videos to help understand the technology and aid into my work.


Step 4: Creation Stage

    - Decides how data will be structured in the database

    - Developed working API to connect backend with frontend

    - Ensured basic CRUD functionality 

Step 5: Testing

    - Used POSTAMN to test API calls (GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE)

    - Tested CRUD functionality using JUnit and Mockito suite in Java
    
    - Tested manually to triple check working condition of website


Step 6: Creation Stage (Part 2)

    - Having in idea of website design was able to implement frontend and backend

        -> Navigation around the website

        -> API calls
        
        -> CRUD functionality
        
        -> Responsive design


Step 7: Testing (Part 2)

    - Checked that everything works as intended.


Conclusion
-----------

Highs:

    - Successfully implemented API backend
    - Successfully implemented CRUD functionality
    - Implemented responsive design
    - Tested my application with success
    - Most of the features work as intended
    - Accessible design

Lows:

    - Have not met all set backlog tasks
        -> Login and search bar were tricky to implement hence not included in final website
